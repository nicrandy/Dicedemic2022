Inspired during the start of the pandemic in 2020, Dicedemic is a combination of [Yahtzee](https://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/yahtzee.pdf) + [Dark Souls](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Lore) + [Covid](https://www.restobiz.ca/the-lasting-changes-and-passing-fads-of-covid-19/).

Dicedemic was build with the [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/) and exported in HTML5
